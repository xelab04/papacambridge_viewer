This is just a spaghetti of code which I use to open the proper webpages on PapaCambridge, the Cambridge past paper hosting website.
I hate having to backtrack from one file to then enter another branch and find the next relevant one
(such as Nov_2013_ms12 to Jun_2016_ms11)

Characteristics of code:
  ✓ Features a god awful TKinter GUI.
  ✓ Is less ordered than a bowl of spaghetti.
  ✓ More _if_ statements than it would take to hardcode an AI.
  ✓ Is hardcoded to Physics A level, for my syllabus.
  ✓ Doesn't give two hoots about papers pre-2010.
  
  ✗ Is as customisable as my IDE.
  ✗ Features good Python practices.
  ✗ Makes me look like a good programmer.
  
Honestly, do what you want with this. If you want to improve on it, I have two things to say to you:
  1. You are courageous or insane or both
  2. You have my utmost respect

If you actually do use/appreciate it, leave a reply to https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/to8jhz/comment/i2658dl
Maybe then, I'll add other subjects and their own spaghetti blocks. Just kidding. I'll do it out of my own free will at some point.
